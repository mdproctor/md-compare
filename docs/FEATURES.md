# Feature Backlog

Planned and completed features for DraftHouse.

## Done

- [x] Two-panel rendered markdown viewer (marked.js + highlight.js)
- [x] LCS line diff with canvas minimap (red=A-side, green=B-side)
- [x] Inline block diff markers (border-top/bottom on changed blocks, `.diff-del` / `.diff-ins`)
- [x] Click-to-scroll on minimap bars
- [x] Scroll sync toggle (percentage-based, `Cmd+S`)
- [x] Draggable panel divider
- [x] File picker (native dialog + drag-and-drop)
- [x] Editable panel labels
- [x] Live file watch (SSE EventSource, ref-counted per path)
- [x] Quarkus backend (FileResource, WatchResource, UiResource, CritiqueResource stub)
- [x] `java-server.js` process manager with crash recovery
- [x] Playwright E2E tests: happy path (9) + regression (4) + swap panels (9) + nav (7) + diff summary (8) + word diff (11) = 48 total, 46 passing, 2 intentionally skipped
- [x] Phase 2 critique panel placeholder (layout ready, content empty)

## Done — recent

- [x] **Swap panels (A↔B)** — ⇄ button in topbar swaps paths, content, and labels atomically; disabled until both panels loaded
- [x] **Next/prev diff navigation** — ↑↓ topbar buttons + `n`/`p` keyboard; `N/M` counter; viewport-recalibrating nav; minimap click fixed to scroll both panels
- [x] **Diff summary** — `~N −N +N` topbar label shows modified/deleted/inserted block counts; CSS hover tooltip explains symbols
- [x] **Word-level diff** — changed words highlighted within mod blocks via DOM-walking LCS diff; preserves inline formatting (bold, italic, code, links); bug fix: `annotateRendered` now correctly tags paragraph elements (marked v9 paragraphs have `rawLines=0`, fixed via `endForCheck = Math.max(tokenEnd, line+1)`)

## Planned

### Diff viewer completeness
- [ ] **Improved scroll sync** — heading-anchor interpolation with percentage fallback (issue #3)
- [ ] **Diff legend** — small colour key (red = A only, green = B only) somewhere unobtrusive

### Phase 2 — DraftHouse MVP

See research spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-26-document-review-tool-research.md`

- [ ] MCP tool surface (start_review, push_revision, get_cursor_context, get_diff, end_review)
- [ ] Qhorus channels for conversation threading
- [ ] Single LLM reviewer via LangChain4j
- [ ] Git worktree versioning (JGit)
- [ ] Quarkus Playwright E2E tests (replacing deleted JS Playwright suite)

### Post-MVP

- [ ] Selection-scoped conversation channels
- [ ] Multi-LLM reviewers with personality library
- [ ] ReviewStrategy SPI
- [ ] Multi-document working sets
- [ ] GraalVM native image
